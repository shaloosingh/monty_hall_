### ðŸ“– About the Monty Hall Problem
- There are 3 doors. Behind one door is a car (prize); behind the others, goats.
- You pick a door.
- The host, who knows what is behind the doors, opens another door, revealing a goat.
- You are then given the choice to **stay** with your original choice or **switch** to the remaining door.
- **Switching** gives you a 2/3 chance of winning, **staying** only a 1/3 chance!
